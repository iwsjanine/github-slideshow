# FNOL Step 7 - Review and Submit

Once you reach FNOL Step 7, the information you have collected should be complete. If it is not, this is your opportunity to refine, edit or finalize the information collected before submission. 

If you click **Continue** on the Damaged Property screen, you will automatically be directed to the Review and Submit screen. You can also access the Review and Submit screen by selecting the FNOL Draft from the File a Claim screen if you completed the prior screen before exiting.

* Each of the steps where you entered information is available for review. You can use the **+ Expand All** and **- Collapse All** controls to open or close all the sections simultaneously.

* To review each section individually, click the expand icon to open the section for review.

* Vehicles and parties appear as links that you can click to return to the original form where you can make changes. 

* To change information such as damaged property, you can click the **Back** button to return to the section within the seven-step workflow and make changes.  

## Submit

Click **Submit** to complete the Claims FNOL workflow when you have completed reviewing and finalizing collected information.
