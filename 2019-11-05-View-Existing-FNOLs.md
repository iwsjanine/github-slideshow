# Viewing existing FNOLs

If you need to open an existing FNOL to review or complete the record before submission, find your incomplete FNOL in the **FNOL Drafts** section on the **File a Claim **screen. 

## View existing FNOLs

When you click on one of the incomplete FNOL records on the **File a Claim** screen, the system takes you to the last page modified in the process. 

**Note: **BriteCore Claims is configured to adapt to lines of business your company writes. Much of what you will see in the Claims module is common to all lines of business, but certain sections are line-of-business specific. The documentation indicates where these variations exist.
