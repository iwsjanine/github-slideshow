# Parties and Contacts in Claims

Claims includes a number of forms for collecting information about individuals and organizations. As you create FNOLs, you will encounter many of these forms. 

Parties are claims-specific contact records in BriteCore. Multiple parties can be involved in documenting a claim.

**Note**: Only one named insured is allowed per claim. Create separate claims for other insureds if you have a loss involving multiple insureds. 

The following table includes different types of individuals and organizations that can comprise the parties linked to a single claim. The Form Type field explains the differences, when they exist, in the kind of information that is collected.
