# Parties and Contacts in Claims

Claims includes a number of forms for collecting information about individuals and organizations. As you work through the FNOL creation process, you will encounter many of these forms. 

Parties are similar to contact records in BriteCore. What sets them apart is being associated with a claim. Party contact information is essentially the same as any other contact record in the system but will likely include additional information as well as be linked to the claims record in BriteCore. 

Note that only one insured is allowed in a claim. Create separate claims for other insureds if you have a loss involving multiple insureds. 

The following table includes different types of individuals and organizations that can comprise the parties linked to a single claim.
