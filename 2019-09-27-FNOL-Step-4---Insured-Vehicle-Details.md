# FNOL step 4 - insured vehicle details

The **Insured Vehicle Details** screen allows users to record details about the insured property and the individuals or organizations associated with a claim. 

If you click **Continue** on the **Loss Details** screen, you will automatically be directed to the **Insured Vehicle Details** screen. You can also access the **Insured Vehicle Details** screen by selecting the FNOL file from the **File a Claim** screen when you have completed the prior screen before exiting.

The first step is to identify the insured vehicle.

1. In the **Insured Vehicle** dropdown list, make a selection from the following options:

* A vehicle that exists in the system. Selecting this option will open the **insured vehicle** dialog. Follow the instructions in the i[nsured vehicle flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MI9WLLQKg_NRnLtKnYQpB8nJpiWyODKH1EMnpBRTxs/edit#) topic. 

* **Add Non-Listed Vehicle**. Selecting this option will open the **add non-listed vehicle **dialog. Follow the instructions in the n[on-listed vehicle flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15buMOj2O9vkgefoafkVrqMR_wINVQciMEmaomTZkjzk/edit) topic. 

* None. Selecting this option will require no further information. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next screen. 

2. After confirming your choices, click **Continue** to proceed to the next screen in the Claims FNOL process.
