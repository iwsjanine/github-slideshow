# FNOL Step 4 - Insured Vehicle Details

The Insured Vehicle Details screen allows users to record details about the insured property and the individuals or organizations associated with a claim. 

If you click **Continue** on the Loss Details screen, you will automatically be directed to the Insured Vehicle Details screen. You can also access the Insured Vehicle Details screen by selecting the FNOL Draft from the File a Claim screen when you have completed the prior screen before exiting.

The first step is to identify the insured vehicle.

1. Make a selection from the Insured Vehicle dropdown:

* If you select None - no other information is required at this phase. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next screen. 

* If you select a vehicle that exists in the system, the **Insured Vehicle** dialog appears. Follow the instructions in the [Insured Vehicle Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MI9WLLQKg_NRnLtKnYQpB8nJpiWyODKH1EMnpBRTxs/edit#) topic. 

* If you need to add a vehicle to the system, you can select Add Non-Listed Vehicle** **to display the **Add Non-Listed Vehicle **dialog. Follow the instructions in the [Non-Listed Vehicle Flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15buMOj2O9vkgefoafkVrqMR_wINVQciMEmaomTZkjzk/edit) topic. 

2. After confirming your choices, click **Continue** to proceed to the next screen in the Claims FNOL process.
