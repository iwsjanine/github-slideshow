# FNOL step 4 - insured vehicle details

The **Insured Vehicle Details** screen allows users to record details about the insureds vehicle, property in the vehicle and the individuals or organizations that own the vehicle, the driver, passengers, and associated parties. 

If you click **Continue** on the **Loss Details** screen, you will automatically be directed to the **Insured Vehicle Details** screen. If you exit the FNOL wizard before going to Step 2, you can re-enter the FNOL from the FNOL list on the **File a Claim** screen.

The first step is to identify the insured vehicle.

1. In the **Insured Vehicle** dropdown list, make a selection from the following options:

* Vehicles that are listed on the policy. Selecting this option will open the **insured vehicle** dialog. Follow the instructions in the [insured vehicle flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MI9WLLQKg_NRnLtKnYQpB8nJpiWyODKH1EMnpBRTxs/edit#) topic. 

* Add Non-Listed Vehicle. Selecting this option will open the add non-listed vehicle dialog. Follow the instructions in the [non-listed vehicle flow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15buMOj2O9vkgefoafkVrqMR_wINVQciMEmaomTZkjzk/edit) topic. Note:  Non listed vehicles can be a result of:

    * borrowed

    * rented

    * recently purchased and within the grace period for being added to the policy

    * due to an OOSE (out of sequence endorsement)

* None. Selecting this option will require no further information. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next screen.
