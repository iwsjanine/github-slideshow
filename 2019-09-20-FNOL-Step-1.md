# FNOL Step 1 - Policy Search

The Policy Search screen allows users to document the time of loss and type of loss, and it allows users to link the loss to a policy. Policy Search is the first step in creating a new First Notice of Loss (FNOL). To Navigate to the Policy Search screen, to begin the FNOL process, follow these steps:

1. Select **Claims** from the BriteCore sidebar.

2. Select **File a Claim** from the Claims menu. 

3. Select ** + New FNOL**. 

## Create a New FNOL 

1. In the **Date of Loss **box, select the calendar to choose the date from the date picker.

2. In the **Time of Loss** box, select the clock to choose the exact time from the time picker.

3. In the **Loss Category** drop-down list, select a loss category value: 

    * Multi-vehicle accident

    * Single-vehicle accident

    * Glass only

    * Tow only

    * Theft

    * Fire

    * Vandalism

    * Weather Damage

    * Other

4. Search for and locate the policy against which the claim is to be made: 

    * To search by policy number 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select **Policy Number**

        * Type the policy number, or as much of the policy number that you know,  in the **Policy Number** text box

    * To search by the insured's phone number 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select **Phone Number** 

        * Type the insured's phone number in the **Phone Number** text box 

    * To search by the insured's name and address 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select** Name/Address** 

        * Type a partial or full name and address of the insured. **Note:** If the insured's address was entered using the optional second street address, the system requires this line to be entered.  

5. Click **Search** 

6. In the Matching Policies table, locate the insured from the list of returned results. The **View More** button appears when additional policies match the search criteria, but do not appear in the initial view of the Matching Policies table.

7. Select the radio button of the associated policy that covers the insured for the incident recorded. When you click on a policy that has claims against it, the Claim History section populates with associated claims records.

    * When you select a policy, the Claim History and Coverages for the policy display. The information is presented as information. No action is needed. Please see the Claim History section below for details of displayed information. 

8. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next section of the Claims FNOL process.

## Claim History

When a loss history exists, records display in the Claim History section. The columns in the table display as follows: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Claim Number </td>
    <td>System-generated number specific to a claim record. Includes the reported date.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary Adjuster</td>
    <td>The assigned adjuster responsible for the required adjustment activities and the primary contact for the adjuster activities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total Incurred 
</td>
    <td>The available loss reserves plus losses paid to date. Or, the sum (of all reserve changes, including increases and decreases) minus the sum (of all payments) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loss Category </td>
    <td>A BriteCore configured term, loss categories are defined by your company according to lines of business.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loss Location</td>
    <td>The location entered on the Loss Details  screen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Claim status options are configurable in BriteCore. Possible  status values include New and Closed. </td>
  </tr>

## Coverages

The Coverages section displays the coverages associated with the policy that you are building the FNOL against. 

The specific information that appears will differ according to the line of business associated with the policy.  

The sample below shows a coverage associated with an auto policy, so the driver is listed as a necessary data point recorded in auto policies. When a homeowners policy is presented, the insured may display as the homeowner. All associated coverages on the policy are listed in this section.
