# FNOL Step 1 - Policy Search

The Policy Search screen allows users to document the time and type of loss and allows users to link the loss to a policy. Because losses must be associated with an existing policy, searching and selecting the policy is the first step in creating a new First Notice of Loss (FNOL). To navigate to the Policy Search screen and begin the FNOL process, follow these steps:

1. Select **Claims** from the BriteCore sidebar.

2. Select **File a Claim** from the Claims menu. 

3. Select ** + New FNOL**. 

## Create a New FNOL 

1. In the **Date of Loss **box, select the calendar to choose the event date from the date picker.

2. In the **Time of Loss** box, select the clock to choose the exact time from the time picker.

3. In the **Loss Category** dropdown list, select a loss category value.Note: The following options are configurable, your list may be different:  

    * Multi-vehicle accident

    * Single-vehicle accident

    * Glass only

    * Tow only

    * Theft

    * Fire

    * Vandalism

    * Weather Damage

    * Other

4. Search for and locate the policy against which the claim is to be made: 

    * To search by policy number 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select **Policy Number**

        * Type the full or partial  in the **Policy Number** box

    * To search by the insured's phone number 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select **Phone Number** 

        * Type the insured's phone number in the **Phone Number**  box 

    * To search by the insured's name and address 

        * In the **Searching By** drop-down list, select** Name/Address** to display the **Full Name**, **Street Address**, **Street Address 2**, **City**, **State**, and **Zip** boxes. 

            * Enter as much information as you know in the **Full Name** and **Address** boxes.

            * If you enter the insured's state in the State box, the Full Name and City boxes are also required. **Note:** If the insuredâ€™s address was entered using the optional second street address, the system requires this line to be entered.  

5. Click **Search.** 

6. In the Matching Policies table, locate the insured from the list of returned results. You can choose to **View More** when additional policies match the search criteria than initially displayed in the Matching Policies table.

7. Select the radio button of the associated policy that covers the insured for the incident recorded. When you click on a policy that has previously added claims, the Claim History section populates with associated claims records.

Note:  When you select a policy, the Claim History and Coverages for the policy display. The information is supplemental and does not require action.Please see the Claim History section below for details of displayed information. 

8. Click **Continue** to proceed to Step 2 of the Claims FNOL process.

## Coverages

The Coverages section displays the coverages associated with the policy from which you are building the FNOL. Coverage information reflects the lines of business and amounts associated with the policy.

The sample below shows a coverage associated with an auto policy, so the driver is listed as a necessary data point as required by  auto policies. When a homeowners policy is presented, the insured may display as the homeowner. All associated coverages on the policy are listed in this section.
