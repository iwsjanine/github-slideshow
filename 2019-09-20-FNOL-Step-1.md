# FNOL Step 1 - Policy Search

## Create a New FNOL 

BriteCore Claims includes several pages in this workflow that systematically walk you through the process of filing a claim. This information becomes part of the permanent record of claims you enter. 

To begin creating a first notice of loss, follow these steps:

1. Click Claims from the Claims sidebar

2. Click **File a Claim**

3. Click **+ New FNOL**

4. Click the calendar and choose a date f in the** Date of Loss** box

5. Click the clock and record the exact time by clicking the hour and minutes in the **Time of Loss** box

6. Select a **Loss Category**:

    * Multi-vehicle accident

    * Single-vehicle accident

    * Glass only

    * Tow only

    * Theft

    * Fire

    * Vandalism

    * Weather Damage

    * Other

7. Search for and locate the policy against which the claim is to be made 

    * If you know the policy number, choose the Policy Number option in the Searching By drop-down list and enter the policy number in the Policy Number entry box

    * If you know the insured's phone number, choose the Phone Number option from the Searching By drop-down list and enter the insured’s phone number in the Phone Number entry box 

    * If you know the insured's name and address, choose the Name / Address option from the Searching By drop-down list and enter a partial or full name and address of the insured. Note the required fields in the Name and Address section. If the insured’s address was entered using the optional second street address, the system requires this line to be entered.  

8. Click **Search** 

9. Locate the insured from the list of returned results in the Matching Policies table. When more undisplayed policies exist in the system, the **View more** button appears. 

10. Select the associated policy

11. When ready, click **Continue** to proceed to the next section

### Matching Policies - Search Results

Your search returns a set of policies that match the criteria entered. If the search criteria you entered returns more policies than display at first, the **View more** button appears so you can see more policies. 

Select the policy that covers the insured for the incident recorded. When you click on a policy that has claims against it, the Claim History section populates with associated claims records. 

## Claim History

When a loss history exists, records display in the Claim History section. The columns in the table display as follows: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Claim Number </td>
    <td>System-generated number specific to a claim record. Includes the reported date.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary Adjuster</td>
    <td>The assigned adjuster responsible for the required adjustment activities and the primary contact for the adjuster activities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total Incurred 
</td>
    <td>The available loss reserves + losses paid to date. Or, the sum (of all reserve changes, including increases and decreases) - the sum (of all payments) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loss Category </td>
    <td>A BriteCore configured term, loss categories are defined by your company according to lines of business.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loss Location</td>
    <td>The location entered on the Reported By page when completing FNOL pages. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Status</td>
    <td>Claim status options are configurable in BriteCore. Possible  status values could include New and Closed. </td>
  </tr>
</table>


 When you click on a claim in the Claim History section, the claim opens in another tab.

## Coverages

The Coverages section appears the coverages associated with the policy that you are building the FNOL against. 

The specific information that appears will differ according to the line of business associated with the policy.  

The sample below shows a coverage associated with an auto policy,so the driver is listed as a necessary datapoint recorded in auto policies. When a homeowners policy is presented, the insured may display as the homeowner. All associated coverages on the policy are listed in this section.
