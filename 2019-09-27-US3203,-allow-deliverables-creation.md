# Allow Deliverables Creation 

### Advanced Setting

#### BriteQuote

**Purpose:** With the **allow-deliverables-creation** advanced setting in the **B****rite****Q****uote** section, agents can create and print the "Insured Scoring Notification" prior to submitting the application through the **Create Custom Deliverable **button that populates in the Attachments tab of an application. 

**Requirements:** This setting requires a **True**/**False** toggle button.

**Setting Default****:** This setting's default value is **False**, so agents can view custom deliverables, but they can't create them. 

**Changing the Default****:** Changing **allow-deliverables-creation** to **True** triggers BriteCore to allow agents to create and print the "Insured Scoring Notification" prior to submitting the application. 

**Adoption Considerations:** The **Allow agents/agencies to create certain deliverables **setting on the Settings > Modules > BriteQuote screen and the **Allow agents/agencies to generate this deliverable in BriteQuote** setting in Settings > Deliverables > Custom Deliverables must be checked to use **allow-deliverables-creation**. After these settings are checked, the **Create Custom Deliverable **button appears in the Attachments tab of a quote or application.

**Note:** To avoid triggering error messages when you create custom deliverables during quoting, you should first complete as much of the quote or application as possible. Required data includes policy type, contact information (social security number), and the underwriting questions.
