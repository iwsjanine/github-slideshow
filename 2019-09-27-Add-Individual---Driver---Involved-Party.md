# Add driver, involved and non-involved, individual / passenger

The forms for adding involved and non-involved parties during FNOL are similar  with only a few different fields. Individuals (as opposed to organizations) in a claim include:

* Drivers of vehicles involved in accidents (individuals only).

* Passengers of vehicles involved in accidents with associated exposures (individuals only). 

* Pedestrians or bicyclists who are injured and/or have damaged property, such as a bicycle, (individuals only).

* Witnesses that may have observed accidents, but did not incur any injury or loss (non-involved parties, individuals only). 

* Owners of insured vehicles, claimant vehicles, or damaged property as a result of accidents (includes both individuals and organizations). 

The form to add individuals in the above associations with a claim are nearly identical with the exception of their relationship to the loss. BriteCore Claims tracks the relationship within the system. This documentation topic provides a single set of instructions to help you complete the individual party forms. 

**When an involved party is a primary or named insured** on the policy, information automatically populates to the individual-involved party form. Its information comes from insured contact records linked to the policy. The Information coming from the contact record  is not editable and appears as grayed-out text. It originates in the Contacts module and is shared across multiple BriteCore modules. 

While it is possible to edit Contacts records, it may require different permissions to look up and edit insureds' contact records. When involved parties provide addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses other than what displays, adjusters can add additional instances as needed. 

**Note**: Additional information added to claims party records is claim-file specific and viewable only in party records in claims.

**When an involved party is a third-party claimant** (not a named insured) the adjuster will enter the name, address, phone, and email address information for the first time.  We do not force a search prior to adding 3rd party claimants, however, there will be an optional claims setting that will enable a feature to automatically lookup contacts by SSN, and if there is an SSN entered during FNOL and the system finds a match, allow the adjuster to prefill the involved party record with the information from the existing contact record.  If no match on SSN is found the information entered in the involved party form will create a new contact record in the Contacts module, and post FNOL this contact will be displayed on the Parties Tab of the claim file.
