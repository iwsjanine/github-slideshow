# Add driver, involved and non-involved, individual / passenger

The forms for adding involved and non-involved parties during FNOL are mostly the same and with only a few different fields. Individuals include the varied participants and involved parties in a claim such as:

* Drivers of vehicles involved in accidents (individuals only).

* Passengers of vehicles involved in accidents that may eventually become claimants with exposures associated to them (individuals only). 

* Pedestrians or bicyclists who are injured or have damaged property, such as a bicycle, (individuals only).

* Witnesses that may have observed accidents, but did not incur any injury or loss (non-involved parties, individuals only). 

* Owners of insured vehicles, claimant vehicles, or damaged property as a result of accidents (includes both individuals and organizations). 

The form to add individuals in the above associations with a claim are nearly identical with the exception of their relationship to the loss. BriteCore Claims tracks the relationship within the system. This documentation topic provides a single set of instructions to help you complete the individual party forms. 

When an involved party is a primary or named insured on the policy, information automatically populates to the individual-involved party form. Information coming from the policy is not editable and appears as grayed out text.  When an involved party provides a different address, phone number, or email address than that originating from the policy, then you can add one or more additional addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses.
