# Assign Claims

The **Assign Claims** feature allows supervisors to assign primary adjusters to the **Claims **records they are to adjudicate in BriteClaims. 

To assign one or more claims to adjusters:

1. Select **Claims** from the BriteClaims  Left Sidebar.

2. Select **Assign Claims** from the **Claims **menu. A list of **Unassigned Claims** appears where there is no Primary Adjuster assigned. 

3. Select an adjuster team from the **Teams** dropdown list. 

    * Selecting a team filters the list of available adjusters. **Note**:  A minimum of one team of adjusters is required to use BriteClaims. If your company does not divide assignments by teams, all unassigned claims display for selection.

4. Click the **Filters** button to narrow the list of claims to select. As you select filters, search results will automatically update based on your selection. Each active filter appears in a row to the right of the  **Filters** button. **Note:** To remove a filter, click the **X** next to the filter you intend to remove. 

    * In the **Line of Business **dropdown list, select a line of business to view. 

    * In the **Loss Type **dropdown list, select the loss type to view. 

    * In the **Select Address** dropdown list, select one of the address types recorded in the Claim record. Options included:

        * Loss Location

        * Insured Address

Once you select an address type, City, State, and Zip boxes appear. Use each address filter element to further narrow the list of unassigned claims. 

* In the **Loss or  Insured Address - City** box, type the address of the loss location or type the street address of the insured. 

* In the **Loss or InsuredAddress** **- State** box, type the state abbreviation of the loss location or type the state abbreviation linked to the insured's address.

* In the **Loss or Insured Address - Zip** -box, type the zip code of the loss location or type the zip code linked to the insured's address. 	

    * In the **Coverage Type** dropdown list, select the coverage type to view.

    * In the **Loss Date** box, use the **From** - **To** date picker to select the date range you intend to view.

5. If your search results total more than 10 claims, the maximum number displayed on each page, the **View More** button appears. Click the button to view more claims. 

6. From the list of claims on the screen, select each claim to assign by clicking the checkbox at the beginning of the claim row. You can use the checkbox in the table heading row to select or deselect all the options on the screen of  the list of unassigned claims. 

7. Once you have selected one or more claims, proceed with one of the following options:

    * Click the **Assign Selected Claims** dropdown list to assign a single adjuster. Select a name from the list.

## Results of assigning claims

Once assigned, the name of the adjuster appears:

* On the **Parties** tab under **Claim** **Assignments**.

* In the **Claim** screen header as the primary adjuster.

* On the **Exposures** screen in the expandable exposure tree as the exposure-level adjuster.

    * When the primary adjuster is assigned for the first time, BriteClaims business rules automatically assigns the primary adjuster as the exposure-level adjuster for all new and existing exposures for the claim.

    * Supervisors and primary adjusters can reassign exposure-level adjusters when needed. 

*  On the Claim file **Exposure** screen under the **Primary Adjuste**r heading and in the **Exposures** table under **Coverage**. 

Once assigned, adjusters can begin researching and validating their claims. 

## Reassign exposures

Supervisors and primary adjusters can reassign exposures in BriteClaims. By default, the primary adjuster is automatically assigned to every level of activity that requires an assigned adjuster.
