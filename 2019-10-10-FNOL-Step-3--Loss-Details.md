# FNOL Step 3 - Loss Details

 The **Loss Details** screen allows users to add detailed information to the data already recorded. 

If you click **Continue** on the **Reported By** screen, you will automatically be directed to the **Loss Details** screen. You can also access the **Loss Details** screen by selecting an FNOL draft from the File a Claim screen when you have completed the prior screen before exiting the incomplete FNOL.
