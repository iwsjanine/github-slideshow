# File a Claim - FNOL Overview

Filing claims in BriteCore begins with the First Notice of Loss (FNOL). The primary focus of creating First Notice of Loss (FNOL) records is to collect comprehensive information about an occurrence for use when investigating and validating resulting claims. 

BriteCore Claims includes several pages in the FNOL workflow that systematically walk you through the process of filing a claim. This information becomes part of the permanent record of claims you enter. 

The File a Claim screen in Claims displays a summary of existing FNOL records before they have been submitted for approval as claims. This screen is where you begin new FNOLs when claims are reported. 

You can save your work and go back to any screen in the process. When you open the FNOL record on the File a Claim screen, the system remembers where you left off and displays that screen. You can save your work and come back to it at any time before submitting the FNOL.

## FNOL - 7 Step Workflow

The workflow developed for claims data collection includes several forms to complete. A workflow wizard guides you through the steps as you construct your multilayered records of information. As you build information in the system, it is organized and presented as selection choices for you when needed throughout the FNOL process so you will not need to enter the same information more than once. The policy and the insured's details are available for selection after you link the policy to the claim in the first step.

[Step 1 - Policy Search](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmgs-bl1gRpUo0XqgVVR7u1C-QgJ-uX5I7gdIQqhcY0/edit#heading=h.emsrcwrb8pl) - In this step, record the date, time, and category of loss. Search and locate the policy associated with the loss. Information from the policy becomes available to select in the following screens. 

[Step 2 - Reported By ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hbswqcQt1hb-OTHa93v7Fw-YLeL7zC2rYfCHWH7lTcI/edit)- In this step, record the details of how the loss was reported and who reported the loss event.

[Step 3 - Loss Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZpQcsbDSHZA7XVGZ2Eo8XEbiC0PeHW3dva-1BXhPtg/edit) - In this step, provide additional information about how and where the loss occurred.

[Step 7 - Review and Submit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eo4Od5PVhKufXAkM-J3oxbD_4AC-jwoN1qjvYTp_hvc/edit) - In this step, review all information collected and recorded in the claim. You can go back to any screen in the process and rework or add details before you submit your FNOL. 

## Data Collection of Parties in Claims

The primary task of creating the FNOL is collecting the best information possible surrounding the loss. All the individuals and organizations involved must be identified and their contact information collected and recorded. Depending on the conditions and extenuating circumstances of the loss, there may be varied individuals and organizations involved. Please review the [Parties and Contacts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ScJQ3eKlgKAdwI_ABuGP0PGFrngi3dqceg71fbMT3Q/edit#heading=h.ic9k3unjx7lt) topic for more information.
