# File a Claim - FNOL Overview

Filing claims in BriteCore begins with the First Notice of Loss (FNOL). The primary focus of creating FNOL records is to collect comprehensive information about a loss occurrence for use when investigating and validating resulting claims in addition to attaching a policy to the claim. 

BriteCore Claims includes several screens in the FNOL workflow that systematically walk you through the process of filing a claim. This information becomes part of the permanent record of the claims you enter. 

The File a Claim screen displays a summary of existing FNOL records that have not yet been  submitted as a claim. This screen is where you begin entering a new FNOL when reporting a claim. 

You can save your work and go back to any screen in the process.  If you are in the middle of entering an FNOL, the system automatically saves your work where you left off. When you open the FNOL record on the File a Claim screen, the system remembers your last step location and displays that screen. You can save your work and come back to it at any time before submitting the FNOL.

## FNOL - 7-Step Workflow for Personal Auto

When you enter claims data in BriteCore, you will complete several forms. A workflow wizard guides you through the steps and forms as enter information about a claim. Each information block you build is organized and presented as selection choices later in the FNOL process so you will not need to enter the same information more than once. After searching and linking the policy to the claim in the first step of the FNOL process, the policy and its named insured's details are available for selection.

## Data Collection of Parties in Claims

The primary task of creating the FNOL is collecting the best information possible surrounding the loss. All the individuals and organizations involved can be identified and their contact information collected and recorded. Depending on the conditions and extenuating circumstances of the loss, there may be varied individuals and organizations involved. Please review the [Parties and Contacts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ScJQ3eKlgKAdwI_ABuGP0PGFrngi3dqceg71fbMT3Q/edit#heading=h.ic9k3unjx7lt) topic for more information.
